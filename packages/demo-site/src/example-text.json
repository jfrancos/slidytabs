  "Tabs": "Use `shadcn` Tabs the way you normally would, and let your framework pass the root `Tabs` element to `slidytabs`.",
  "ShadcnControlled": "You can control the value via the usual `shadcn` props.",
  "SlidytabsControlled": "Alternatively, with `slidytabs`, you can control it using indices. Setting `defaultValue` helps avoid a flash during hydration.",
  "Slider": "Same usage as above, with drag support. This example goes deeper into controlled usage and explores some custom styling.\n\nContinuous interaction is valuable when it drives continuous updates elsewhere in the UI, but a traditional slider isn’t the right abstraction here.",
  "Sticky": "The sticky param lets you define a permanent endpoint, while still passing around a single index.",
  "Vertical": "A vertical example",
  "Range": "Similar usage as above, but now we're passing around tuples (`[number, number]`). At the moment, there’s no mechanism to avoid a hydration flash when using `range()`.",
  "Push": "Use `push` to let one endpoint push the other."
